There are two main steps that we need to follow in order to migrate from CentOS 7 to Rocky Linux 8.

1. Upgrade CentOS 7 to CentOS 8
2. Migrate from CentOS 8 to Rocky Linux


Step 1. Gather System Information
Get the necessary system information such as the kernel version and the version of the applications installed on the system.

Upgrade and reboot CentOS 7
  sudo yum -y update
  sudo reboot

Check the Kernel version
  # uname -r
    [output example don't copy 3.10.0-1160.36.2.el7.x86_64]

Step 2. Install EPEL-Release
Install Epel-release to allow you to download packages outside CentOS-Base repo.

  sudo yum install epel-release -y

Step 3. Install Packages
Install the following packages that will be used in the upgrade process.

  sudo yum install -y yum-utils rpmconf

Step 4. Remove Unused and Conflicting Packages/Configuratons
Locate and remove unused and conflicting packages from previous installations

  sudo rpmconf -a

List unneeded packages

  sudo package-cleanup --leaves

Get the list of duplicate packages

  sudo package-cleanup --orphans

Remove the packages from the above commandâ€™s output using the YUM command

  sudo yum remove -y <package>

Step 5. Upgrade from YUM to DNF
Install DNF package manager, the default package manager for CentOS 8.

  sudo yum install -y dnf

Remove YUM package manager.

  sudo dnf remove -y yum yum-metadata-parser

Delete the YUM configurations

  sudo rm -Rf /etc/yum

Lastly, build cache for DNF repositories

  sudo dnf -y makecache
 
Step 6. Upgrade CentOS 7 Packages
Upgrade CentOS packages before we can upgrade the server to CentOS 8.

  sudo dnf upgrade -y
  
Step 7. Upgrade YUM repositories
Upgrade YUM repositories from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8

  sudo dnf install http://vault.centos.org/8.5.2111/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/{centos-linux-repos-8-3.el8.noarch.rpm,centos-linux-release-8.5-1.2111.el8.noarch.rpm,centos-gpg-keys-8-3.el8.noarch.rpm}

Upgrade EPEL-Release repo.

  sudo dnf upgrade -y epel-release
  #OR
  sudo dnf -y upgrade https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

Step 8. Upgrade CentOS 7 to CentOS 8
Update CentOS 8 repositories:

  cd /etc/yum.repos.d
  sudo mkdir backups
  sudo mv CentOS-* backups

  # Create new for CentOS BaseOS repo
  sudo tee CentOS-Linux-BaseOS.repo<<EOM
  [baseos]
  name=CentOS Linux \$releasever - BaseOS
  baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/8.5.2111/BaseOS/\$basearch/os/
  gpgcheck=1
  enabled=1
  gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
  EOM

  # Create new for CentOS AppStream repo
  sudo tee CentOS-Linux-AppStream.repo<<EOM
  [appstream]
  name=CentOS Linux \$releasever - AppStream
  baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/8.5.2111/AppStream/\$basearch/os/
  gpgcheck=1
  enabled=1
  gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
  EOM
  
  Remove the current CentOS Kernel
  
  sudo rpm -e `rpm -q kernel` --nodeps
  sudo rpm -e `rpm -q kernel-devel` --nodeps
  
Remove all conflicting packages

  sudo rpm -e --nodeps sysvinit-tools
  
Launch CentOS 8 system upgrade with the command below:

  sudo dnf -y --releasever=8 --allowerasing --setopt=deltarpm=false distro-sync
  
Note: You may encounter conflicting packages errors. To solve them remove existing packages in question. I had to remove the following packages before upgrade could succeed.

NetworkManager
dracut-network
python36-rpmconf
Install the new CentOS 8 Kernel.

  sudo dnf install -y kernel-core

  #OR

Install CentOS 8 minimal.

  sudo dnf -y groupupdate "Core" "Minimal Install"


After a successful installation, reboot your system to load the new kernel

  sudo systemctl reboot
  
Verify that your system has upgraded successfully and that you still have your applications.

  $ cat /etc/redhat-release
  [example output: CentOS Linux release 8.5.2111]
  
With this, we can now confirm that we have successfully upgraded from CentOS 7 to CentOS 8. The next step will be to migrate from CentOS 8 to Rocky Linux 8 which can be found in a separate txt file.
